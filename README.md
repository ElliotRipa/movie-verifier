# Movie Verifier

A project to verify that the movies I have on my hard drive are also logged in my database.  
This project uses absolute paths for locations on my computer and uses the local address for my database.  
tl;dr This project is just for me, and you won't be able to use it... But feel free to poke around if you want.
